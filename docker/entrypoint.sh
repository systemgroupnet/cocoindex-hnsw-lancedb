# Runs as PID 1 and keeps the container alive across daemon restarts. The
# daemon intentionally exits whenever the client issues `StopRequest`
# (settings-change mtime mismatch, version upgrade, etc.); the `while`
# loop respawns it in place so the container stays up.
#
# Why not `exec ccc run-daemon`: if the daemon were PID 1, any daemon
# exit would take the container down with it — breaking auto-restart on
# `global_settings.yml` edits.
#
# The SIGTERM/SIGINT trap forwards `docker stop` to the daemon child so
# graceful shutdown still flows through the normal cleanup path.
